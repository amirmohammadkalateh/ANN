# Project Title

A Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model for Image Classification on the CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Description

This repository provides an example implementation of a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32×32 color images labeled into 10 distinct classes. This project demonstrates how to:

- Load and preprocess the dataset.  
- Build and train a CNN model for multi-class classification.  
- Evaluate the model performance on the test set.

## Features

- Simple Keras-based CNN architecture for image classification.  
- Easy-to-understand code with comments explaining each step.  
- Configurable hyperparameters (batch size, number of epochs, etc.).  
- Data preprocessing that normalizes pixel values and converts labels to one-hot vectors.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+  
- [TensorFlow 2.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)  
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) (included as part of TensorFlow 2.x)  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (optional, for plotting results)  

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/cifar10-cnn-example.git
   ```
2. Change into the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd cifar10-cnn-example
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # on Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have installed all requirements.  
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_cifar10.py
   ```
3. The script automatically downloads the CIFAR-10 dataset if it is not available locally.  
4. Observe the training progress, including the training and validation accuracy and loss at each epoch.  
5. After the training completes, the script will evaluate the model on the test set and print the test accuracy and loss.

## Project Structure

A typical file structure might look like:

```
cifar10-cnn-example
│
├── train_cifar10.py      # Main training and evaluation script
├── README.md             # Project documentation
├── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
└── .gitignore            # Git ignore file
```

- **train_cifar10.py**: Contains the CNN model definition, training loop, and evaluation pipeline.  
- **README.md**: The file you are currently viewing—contains instructions and documentation for the project.  
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies.

## Model Architecture

This simple CNN model typically includes:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features using multiple filters.  
2. **Max Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions and help control overfitting.  
3. **Flatten Layer**: Convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector before feeding them into fully-connected layers.  
4. **Fully Connected (Dense) Layers**: Map extracted features to predictions.  
5. **Dropout Layer**: Helps prevent overfitting by randomly “dropping” units during training.  
6. **Output Layer**: Uses a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

## Training

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
  - The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 50,000 training and 10,000 test images.  
  - Pixel values are normalized into the [0, 1] range.  
  - One-hot encoding is applied to class labels for multi-class classification.  

- **Training Parameters**  
  - **Optimizer**: [`Adam`](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/adam/) for adaptive learning.  
  - **Loss Function**: [`categorical_crossentropy`](https://keras.io/api/losses/probabilistic_losses/#categoricalcrossentropy-class).  
  - **Metrics**: `accuracy`.  
  - **Epochs**: 15 (modifiable).  
  - **Batch Size**: 64 (modifiable).  

- **Progress Tracking**  
  - During training, the script will print epoch-by-epoch updates of training and validation accuracy and loss.  

## Evaluation

- The trained model is evaluated on the untouched 10,000 test images.  
- The script reports final test **Loss** and **Accuracy**.  
- For better model performance, you can:
  - Increase the number of convolutional layers or filters.  
  - Use dropout more/less aggressively.  
  - Experiment with data augmentation (e.g., random flips, shifts, rotations).  
  - Tune hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, or optimizer.
